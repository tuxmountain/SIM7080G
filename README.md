SIM7080G Arduino Library (Under Development)

Overview

The SIM7080G Arduino library is designed to facilitate communication with the SIM7080G module, a versatile cellular module for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Please note that this library is currently under development and may require some adaptations for use with specific Arduino or ESP boards. However, it provides a solid foundation for working with the SIM7080G module.

For more information about the SIM7080G module, refer to the manufacturer's documentation: SIMCOM SIM7080G.

Key Features

- Cellular Connectivity: Enables cellular communication for IoT projects using the SIM7080G module.
- Easy Integration: Provides a simplified interface for controlling and interacting with the module.
- Flexible Configuration: Allows configuration of various parameters for your specific IoT application.
- Status Reporting: Retrieve information such as signal strength, network status, and more.

Usage

1. Initialization: Create a SIM7080G object by specifying the hardware serial interface connected to the SIM7080G module. For example, SIM7080G sim(Serial2); if you're using Serial2.

2. Begin Communication: Initialize communication with the module by calling sim.begin(baudRate, config);, where baudRate is the desired baud rate, and config is the configuration for the hardware serial interface.

3. Sending AT Commands: Send AT commands to the module using the sim.SendCommand(ATCommand) function, where ATCommand is the AT command to be sent.

4. Receiving Responses: Retrieve responses from the module using sim.WaitForResponse(timeout), where timeout is the maximum time to wait for a response.

5. Cellular Operations: Perform various cellular operations such as connecting to the network, sending SMS, and more using the library functions.

6. Advanced Features: Customize the library to suit your specific IoT application by modifying the code as needed.

Example

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <SIM7080G.h>

SIM7080G sim(Serial2); // Initialize SIM7080G with Serial2

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize the serial monitor
  sim.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1); // Initialize communication with SIM7080G
}

void loop() {
  // Send AT command to check network registration status
  sim.SendCommand("AT+CREG?");
  
  // Wait for a response and print it
  String response = sim.WaitForResponse(1000); // Wait for 1 second
  Serial.println("Response: " + response);
  
  // Your IoT application code here
}

Future Development

Future updates may include additional features, improved error handling, and compatibility with various Arduino and ESP boards.

Important Note

Ensure that the SIM7080G module is properly connected to your Arduino or ESP board and that the power supply and logic levels are compatible.

Please note that this library is currently in development and may require adjustments for specific hardware configurations. Your feedback and contributions are welcome to help improve this library.
